-> When we install any package using npm command, its create a directoy 'node_modules' and put all the libraries inside
the node_modules directoy. So with the time size of this directoy grows upto GBs.

Its recommmend never share/push this directory, SO what?

For Git:
----------
1. create a special file '.gitignore' and provide the path of node_modules directoy i.e.
        TypeScript/node_modules/

2.  git add -> git commit -> git push

3. When the code is in your machine, move to the folder where you have 'package.json' and type below command:

    > npm install   OR > npm update

4. Happy Coding......



1. Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.


2. Two-fer or 2-fer is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

One for name, one for me.
Where "name" is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

One for you, one for me.
Here are some examples:

Name	String to return
Alice	One for Alice, one for me.
Bob	One for Bob, one for me.
