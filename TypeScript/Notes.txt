1. Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.


2. Two-fer or 2-fer is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

One for name, one for me.
Where "name" is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

One for you, one for me.
Here are some examples:

Name	String to return
Alice	One for Alice, one for me.
Bob	One for Bob, one for me.
